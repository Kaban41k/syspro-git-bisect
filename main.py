"""
Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis the Rizzler?

No

I thought not
It's not a story the Betas would tell you
It's a Sigma legend
Darth Rizzler was a Mog Lord of the Sigmas
So powerful and so wise
He could use his rizz to influence the Betas to show their gyat
He became so powerful
The only think he was afraid of was... losing his rizz
which eventually, of course, he did

Is it possible to learn this power?

Not    from    a Beta
