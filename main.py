You're a Sigma male, aren't you?

Are you capping, lil bro?

I saw your jawline
Only Sigmas can have such a mewing streak

Perhaps I mogged a Sigma and fanum taxed him

I don't think so
No one can mog a Sigma

You're a new gen, Anakin
You're cooked


I was once a looksmaxxer the same as your father
He had the best jawline in the galaxy
And he edged a lot
